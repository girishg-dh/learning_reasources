      "3. **Develop User Interface (UI)**:\n",
      "   - This task involves both Jane Doe (Software Engineer) and Bob Smith (Designer) to effectively integrate design and technical implementation. Their collaboration will reduce the likelihood of misalignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **User-Friendly Navigation System**:\n",
      "   - Assigned solely to Jane Doe, allowing her to utilize her engineering skills to create a seamless navigation experience after the UI is designed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Create \"About Us\" Page**:\n",
      "   - Bob Smith is assigned again, as it requires his design expertise, fitting naturally with his ongoing involvement in the design aspects of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Design \"Services\" Page**:\n",

      "\n",
      "7. **Create \"Contact Us\" Page**:\n",
      "   - This task involves both Jane Doe and Bob Smith, as it requires functionality (by Jane) and the design (by Bob) of contact forms, which necessitates teamwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Blog Section Implementation**:\n",
      "   - Jane Doe (Software Engineer) is assigned this task independently, allowing her to focus on backend functionality without interruption from other design tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **SEO and Performance Optimization**:\n",
      "   - Another solo task for Jane Doe, capitalizing on her technical skills post-implementation to ensure the website is optimized before launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Integration of Social Media Links**:\n",
      "    - Jane Doe is assigned this final enhancement after the key pages are complete, which complements her previous work and is critical for user engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Testimonials Section Design**:\n",
      "    - This is again assigned to Bob Smith, who should focus on designs that resonate with the established site aesthetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Quality Assurance Testing**:\n",
      "    - Alice Johnson and Tom Brown (QA Engineers) are paired as they complement each other's expertise for thorough testing across all pages and features.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **Final Review and Project Launch**:\n",
      "    - This task involves John Doe, Jane Doe, Bob Smith, Alice Johnson, and Tom Brown to ensure comprehensive oversight, technical checks, and design alignment before launching the project.\n",
      "\n",
