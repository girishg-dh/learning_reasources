      "1. Core Gameplay Loop and Mechanics:\n",
      "- The core gameplay of Wordle involves players guessing a secret 5-letter word within six attempts.\n",
      "- Players receive feedback after each guess, with letters turning green if they are in the correct position and yellow if they are in the word but in the wrong position.\n",
      "- Players must use logic and deduction to narrow down the possibilities and guess the word correctly within the given attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Target Audience, Key Features, and Unique Selling Points:\n",
      "- Target Audience: Word puzzle enthusiasts, casual gamers, and anyone looking for a fun and challenging brain teaser.\n",
      "- Key Features:\n",
      "  - Daily Puzzle: A new word puzzle is available daily for players to solve.\n",
      "  - Guess Validation: Ensure that player inputs are valid 5-letter English words.\n",
      "  - Feedback System: Provide clear and helpful feedback to guide players in their guessing process.\n",
      "- Unique Selling Points:\n",
      "  - Simple and addictive gameplay.\n",
      "  - Daily challenges to keep players engaged.\n",

      "3. Detailed User Stories and Acceptance Criteria:\n",
      "- User Story 1: As a player, I want to be able to guess the secret word and receive feedback on my guesses.\n",
      "  - Acceptance Criteria: Feedback should be provided after each guess, indicating correct letters in the correct position and correct letters in the wrong position.\n",
      "- User Story 2: As a player, I want to be able to play a new word puzzle daily.\n",
      "  - Acceptance Criteria: A new puzzle should be generated and made available to players each day.\n",
      "- User Story 3: As a player, I want to receive validation on my guesses to ensure they are valid English words.\n",

      "4. Technical Constraints and Non-Functional Requirements:\n",
      "- Technical Constraints:\n",
      "  - Mobile-Responsive: The game should be playable on both desktop and mobile devices.\n",
      "  - Shareable Results: Players should be able to share their results and progress on social media platforms.\n",
