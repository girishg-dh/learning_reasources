      "Delivery Hero SE[3][4] is a German multinational online food ordering and food delivery company based in Berlin, Germany. Founded in 2011, the company operates in 60+ countries internationally in Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin and South America, and the Middle East, and partners with 500,000+ restaurants.[5] Delivery Hero has increasingly branched out beyond food delivery, and is a leading player in the emerging category of quick commerce, which delivers small batch orders in under an hour.[6]\n",
      "In the third quarter of 2021, Delivery Hero processed 791 million orders‚Äîthat equals a year-on-year growth of 52%.[7]\n",
      "While Delivery Hero is headquartered in Germany with offices worldwide, as a \"gig economy company\" (akin to Meituan, Uber or Airbnb) nearly all of the company's deliveries are carried out by workers using motorcycles, bicycles and cars, dispatched via the company's smartphone apps.\n",
      "In general, and in contrast to recent legal precedents in Canada[8] and Australia, Delivery Hero does not classify these couriers as employees. This policy has led to ongoing legal battles and labour disputes, and may be linked to the shutdowns of Delivery Hero's operations in several countries.[9]\n",
      "History[edit]\n",
      "Delivery Hero Holding was founded in Berlin by Niklas √ñstberg, Kolja Hebenstreit, Markus Fuhrmann and Lukasz Gadowski in May 2011, with the goal of turning Delivery Hero into a global online food ordering platform.[10][11] Under the leadership of Niklas √ñstberg and Fabian Siegel, Delivery Hero first expanded to Australia and the United Kingdom in 2011. In early 2012 the enterprise acquired Lieferheld in Germany and acquired a stake in Foodarena, Switzerland.[12]\n",

      "In 2012 and 2013, the harsh competition between the various delivery service online portals led the German press to dub the events as cyberwar between the big web-portals. There were reports of frequent Denial-of-service attacks against each portal, accusations of data stealing as well as numerous lawsuits of the portals against each other. Delivery Hero was one of the more aggressive actors, and in 2012, the Delivery Hero office in Berlin was raided by police and the prosecution pressed charges against the Delivery Hero management. Delivery Hero was prosecuted for perpetrating DoS attacks against its competitors and stealing data from the other web services.[15][16]\n",

      "In 2016, the company was valued at 2 billion euros. Delivery Hero went public in a listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on 30 June 2017. The market valued it at 4 billion euros (twice as much as its original value). The listing was the largest by a European technology business in almost two years.

      "In December 2020, Delivery Hero announced that it would take control of South Korea's biggest food delivery app, Woowa Brothers Corp., at a $4 billion valuation.[34] As part of the transaction, Delivery Hero and the management of Woowa have entered into a strategic partnership regarding the operations of Delivery Hero and Woowa in the Asia Pacific region, and will be able to mutually leverage market insights, technology, and operational best practices.[35]\n",
      "In May 2021, Delivery Hero restarted its German operations following the entry of competitors Uber Eats and Wolt.[36] However, it once again exited the German market in December, citing high costs.[36]\n",
      "In May 2024, Uber announced its intention to purchase Delivery Hero's business in Taiwan, for $1.25 billion.[37]\n",

      "Classification of couriers as independent contractors[edit]\n",
      "In contrast to Delivery Hero's 2018 annual report, which includes \"riders\" as employees,[74] Delivery Hero's national subsidiaries (Foodora, Foodpanda, etc.) usually classify their workers as independent contractors and not employees. This classification frees Delivery Hero from responsibilities towards its workers, including the right to workers' compensation, sick leave, overtime, unemployment benefits, hazard pay, and protections against wrongful termination of employment or firing.\n",
      "Pro-employee rulings[edit]\n",
      "Couriers working for Delivery Hero's brands have mounted campaigns to assert their rights, including several successful legal battles. In Australia and Canada, these campaigns led to DH subsidiary Foodora's shutdown in the countries.[citation needed]\n",
      "In each case, Foodora maintained that the shutdowns were carried out in response to market forces. However, Delivery Hero's 2018 Annual Report shows that the company does indeed assess country-by-country the costs and risks of government policies including social security, stating:\n",
      "\"Country specific and economic requirements, including employment legislation and social security, increase the complexity of the rider management as part of the own delivery services. The constant analysis of regulatory developments is needed to find the best approach in advancing the logistics business. Non-compliance with regulatory requirements may lead to higher rider costs and possible non-compliance fines. This also includes the risk of unavailability of rider personnel restraining the further expansion of the logistic services. This risk is considered as medium.\"[74]\n",
      "Australia[edit]\n",
      "In 2018 Foodora Australia abruptly shut down operations while facing several lawsuits: including one from the country's Fair Work Ombudsman which accused the company of sham contracting,[75] and several court cases relating to unpaid benefits and wrongful dismissal.\n",
      "The Transport Workers Union subsequently accused Foodora of shutting down to \"avoid responsibility for paying its riders millions of dollars in backpay as a result of wage theft.\"[76]\n",
      "Canada[edit]\n",
      "In 2019, Foodora couriers Montreal and Toronto began organizing. Subsequently, with the support of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, Foodsters United, a group of couriers in Ontario, organized a vote on whether or not to unionize with the CUPW. Foodora Canada then challenged the vote prior to the announcement of results, on the basis that Foodora couriers were independent contractors and therefore did not have the right to unionize.\n",
      "The Ontario Labour Relations Board then ruled that Foodora was misclassifying couriers as independent contractors, and, in a decision which was widely considered a win for couriers, ordered Foodora to consider its couriers \"dependent contractors\", a new category which affords workers some of the rights of employees.[77] The decision only applied to couriers in Ontario, but was considered to be precedent setting.\n",
      "In April 2020, two months after Ontario Labour Relations Board decision, Foodora Canada announced that it was shutting down, citing oversaturation of the Canadian market.[78]\n",
      "Greece[edit]\n",
      "In 2021, e-food.gr couriers in Greece were given an ultimatum to switch their working relationship from employees to independent contractors / freelancers. If not, they would not have their employment contracts renewed. This led to social media backlash over workers' rights. The company was forced to recall their decision due to public outcry, and offered contract renewals to its employees if they wish.[79] Following further public scrutiny and strikes organized by its delivery workers, the company eventually promised to upgrade all delivery employees' employment contracts to indefinite duration contracts, signifying a victory for the delivery workers.[80]\n",
      "Monopolistic behaviour[edit]\n",
      "Talabat and Carriage, both of which are owned by Delivery Hero, were sued by the Kuwait Competition Protection Authority (CPA) in 2019 after they refused to pay fines totalling more than 5 million KWD (~$16.5 million) due to their monopolistic acts in their contracts with restaurants.[81]\n",
      "Regulatory fines[edit]\n",
      "In 2023, Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) imposed a 630,000 euro administrative fine on Delivery Hero for failing to disclose inside information.[82]\n",
      "In June 2025, the European Commission fined Delivery Hero and its subsidiary Glovo a combined ‚Ç¨329 million for participating in an antitrust cartel. The companies were found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices between 2018 and 2022, including a no-poach agreement and the exchange of commercially sensitive information. Delivery Hero received a ‚Ç¨223 million fine, while Glovo was fined ‚Ç¨105.7 million, with both firms receiving a 10% reduction for acknowledging their involvement.[83][84]\n",

      "Classification of couriers as independent contractors[edit]\n",
      "In contrast to Delivery Hero's 2018 annual report, which includes \"riders\" as employees,[74] Delivery Hero's national subsidiaries (Foodora, Foodpanda, etc.) usually classify their workers as independent contractors and not employees. This classification frees Delivery Hero from responsibilities towards its workers, including the right to workers' compensation, sick leave, overtime, unemployment benefits, hazard pay, and protections against wrongful termination of employment or firing.\n",
      "Pro-employee rulings[edit]\n",
      "Couriers working for Delivery Hero's brands have mounted campaigns to assert their rights, including several successful legal battles. In Australia and Canada, these campaigns led to DH subsidiary Foodora's shutdown in the countries.[citation needed]\n",
      "In each case, Foodora maintained that the shutdowns were carried out in response to market forces. However, Delivery Hero's 2018 Annual Report shows that the company does indeed assess country-by-country the costs and risks of government policies including social security, stating:\n",
      "\"Country specific and economic requirements, including employment legislation and social security, increase the complexity of the rider management as part of the own delivery services. The constant analysis of regulatory developments is needed to find the best approach in advancing the logistics business. Non-compliance with regulatory requirements may lead to higher rider costs and possible non-compliance fines. This also includes the risk of unavailability of rider personnel restraining the further expansion of the logistic services. This risk is considered as medium.\"[74]\n",
      "Australia[edit]\n",
      "In 2018 Foodora Australia abruptly shut down operations while facing several lawsuits: including one from the country's Fair Work Ombudsman which accused the company of sham contracting,[75] and several court cases relating to unpaid benefits and wrongful dismissal.\n",
      "The Transport Workers Union subsequently accused Foodora of shutting down to \"avoid responsibility for paying its riders millions of dollars in backpay as a result of wage theft.\"[76]\n",
      "Canada[edit]\n",
      "In 2019, Foodora couriers Montreal and Toronto began organizing. Subsequently, with the support of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, Foodsters United, a group of couriers in Ontario, organized a vote on whether or not to unionize with the CUPW. Foodora Canada then challenged the vote prior to the announcement of results, on the basis that Foodora couriers were independent contractors and therefore did not have the right to unionize.\n",
      "The Ontario Labour Relations Board then ruled that Foodora was misclassifying couriers as independent contractors, and, in a decision which was widely considered a win for couriers, ordered Foodora to consider its couriers \"dependent contractors\", a new category which affords workers some of the rights of employees.[77] The decision only applied to couriers in Ontario, but was considered to be precedent setting.\n",
      "In April 2020, two months after Ontario Labour Relations Board decision, Foodora Canada announced that it was shutting down, citing oversaturation of the Canadian market.[78]\n",
      "Greece[edit]\n",
      "In 2021, e-food.gr couriers in Greece were given an ultimatum to switch their working relationship from employees to independent contractors / freelancers. If not, they would not have their employment contracts renewed. This led to social media backlash over workers' rights. The company was forced to recall their decision due to public outcry, and offered contract renewals to its employees if they wish.[79] Following further public scrutiny and strikes organized by its delivery workers, the company eventually promised to upgrade all delivery employees' employment contracts to indefinite duration contracts, signifying a victory for the delivery workers.[80]\n",
      "Monopolistic behaviour[edit]\n",
      "Talabat and Carriage, both of which are owned by Delivery Hero, were sued by the Kuwait Competition Protection Authority (CPA) in 2019 after they refused to pay fines totalling more than 5 million KWD (~$16.5 million) due to their monopolistic acts in their contracts with restaurants.[81]\n",
      "Regulatory fines[edit]\n",
      "In 2023, Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) imposed a 630,000 euro administrative fine on Delivery Hero for failing to disclose inside information.[82]\n",
      "In June 2025, the European Commission fined Delivery Hero and its subsidiary Glovo a combined ‚Ç¨329 million for participating in an antitrust cartel. The companies were found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices between 2018 and 2022, including a no-poach agreement and the exchange of commercially sensitive information. Delivery Hero received a ‚Ç¨223 million fine, while Glovo was fined ‚Ç¨105.7 million, with both firms receiving a 10% reduction for acknowledging their involvement.[83][84]\n",
